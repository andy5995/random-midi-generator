# Random MIDI Generator
Randomly generates musical 'phrases' of any length.

Notes in the phrases are chosen from a scale (within a user-defined octave range) that can be selected or also randomly generated. Note velocities can also be randomly assigned.

## Available scales (in any given key)
- chromatic
- major
- natural minor
- harmonic minor
- major pentatonic
- minor pentatonic
- blues
- whole tone
- octaves

This project makes use of the [midiutil](https://github.com/duggan/midiutil) Python library.
